# Capstone project - PySpark New York City Taxi
This repository contains practice exercises designed to hone PySpark skills, with a focus on data manipulation, cleaning, and exploration. The exercises are based on a subset of the New York City Taxi Trip dataset, which provides a rich and complex set of data to work with.

These exercises are designed to tackle questions of varying difficulty:

1. What is the average distance of taxi trips in NYC within the selected month? (Easy)
2. What are the top 5 pickup locations in the selected month? (Easy)
3. What are the peak times (hour of the day) for taxi trips in NYC within the selected month? (Medium)
4. Analyze the Speed and Efficiency of Taxi Trips and Enrich with Taxi Zone Names (Medium)

This repository is a great resource for anyone learning PySpark or looking to practice their skills. Feel free to explore, use the exercises for your own learning, or suggest improvements. Contributions are welcome!
